**PostgreSQL**

I forgot what the installation process for this is like, but if it prompts you to setup a username and password, make it something you can remember. For instance, you can set both to be "postgres".

**NodeJS**

Just download the recommended version.

**Postman**

Same as the note for NodeJS.

**Some Text Editor or IDE**
http://atom.io/
https://www.sublimetext.com/3
https://code.visualstudio.com/

Any of these will work fine. My personal prefernce is VS Code (the last one).
